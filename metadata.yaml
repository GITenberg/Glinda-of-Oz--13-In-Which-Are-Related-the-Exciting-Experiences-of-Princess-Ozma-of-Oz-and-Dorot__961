description: "Glinda of Oz is the fourteenth Land of Oz book written by children's\
  \ author L. Frank Baum, published on July 10, 1920. It is the last book of the original\
  \ Oz series, which was later continued by other authors. Like most of the Oz books,\
  \ the plot features a journey through some of the remoter regions of Oz; though\
  \ in this case the pattern is doubled: Dorothy and Ozma travel to stop a war between\
  \ the Flatheads and Skeezers; then Glinda and a cohort of Dorothy's friends set\
  \ out to rescue them. The book was dedicated to Baum's second son, Robert Stanton\
  \ Baum.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
